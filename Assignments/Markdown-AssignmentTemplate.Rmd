## Assignment whatever

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
# Loading required libraries
library(viridis)
```

### Question a

*Text of question a *

Answer any questions that require text in the white space. And it's also useful to explain what your code is doing up here. Include any R code in chunks like below. (Note: this is not correct for this)
```{r, include=TRUE}
data("CO2")
class(CO2$Treatment)
nlevels(CO2$Treatment)
treat.colors <- viridis(nlevels(CO2$Treatment)) # viridis() is part of the viridis package
```

Construct plot:
```{r, include=TRUE}
points.shapes <- c(17,19)
plot(uptake ~ conc, data = CO2, 
     xlab = "Concentration of CO2 in air",
     ylab = "Uptake of CO2 by plant",
     pch = points.shapes[CO2$Type],
     col = treat.colors[CO2$Treatment])
legend("topleft", ncol = 2,#inset=c(-0.1,0), 
       legend = c("Quebec, nonchilled", "Quebec, chilled", 
                  "Mississippi, chilled", "Mississippi, chilled"), 
       col = rep(treat.colors,2), 
       pch = rep(points.shapes,each=2))
```

## Question b
