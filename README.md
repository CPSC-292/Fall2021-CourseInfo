## About CPSC 292 

This course is intended to be a first programming course in R for students with no previous experience in computer programming. The course will focus on becoming familiar and functional in the R language using RStudio. We'll learn about objects, data classes and structures, basic programming features (scripting, functions, and flow control), and basic plotting using ggplot2. By the end of the course, students will be able to create simple scripts in R focused on basic data analysis and plotting in a way that is reproducible and replicable. 

The Course Learning Objectives are: 
 1. Understand the basic structure and function of the R programming language.
 2. Understand and follow best practices in scientific computing.
 3. Independently create and perform basic data analysis and visualization in a way that communicates ideas clearly.

## Before Class Starts

It will be useful to having R, RStudio, and git installed and ready to go before class starts on Aug. 30th, 2021. Instructions are below! 

### Instructions for Installing Software

 - Install R: 
    1. Go to: https://cloud.r-project.org/ and select your operating system.  
    2. Click on the latest release of R (it should be something like "R-4.1.0.pkg (notarized and signed)". 
    3. Open the downloaded pkg file and follow instructions to install. Please install R in the suggested, default location. 

 - Install RStudio (do so after installing R): 
    1. Go to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download and select "Download RStudio Desktop". It should detect your operating system automatically. 
    2. Open the downloaded file and follow instructions to install. 

  - Install git: 
    - For Mac OS and Linux, git should already be installed. To check, open "Terminal" app and then type: 
     ```
     git version 
     ```
     If Terminal returns the version of git, you have it! Nothing more to do. If it says command unknown, then you should follow instructions here for installing: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
     - For Windows, check by opening a Windows Command Prompt and entering: 
      ```
      Git Bash
      ```
      If it gives you an unknown command error, follow instructions to install:  
      1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/downloads and select "Windows".
